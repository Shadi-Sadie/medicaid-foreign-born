# Paper 1-Medicaid expansion effects on immigrants insurance gain
 
This repository contains information about my research project on the effect of Medicaid expansion on immigrant insurance coverage. I aim to reach two   goals by creating this repository:

1. To make my research reproducible in such a way that other researchers could reuse my codes and data.
2. To make my life easier by documenting every step I take and being organized.

For this purpos I divided this repo into 4 chunks, data, text, presentation, and codes. I will provide more details for each section.
