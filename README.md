# Medicaid expansion effects on immigrants insurance gain
 
This repository contains information about my research project on the effect of Medicaid expansion on immigrant insurance coverage. I aim to reach two   goals by creating this repository:

1. To make my research reproducible in such a way that other researchers could reuse my codes and data.
2. To make my life easier by documenting every step I take and being organized.

For this purpos I divided this repo into 4 chunks, data, text, presentation, and codes. I will provide more details for each section.

## Data

I will discuss where I gathered the data for this analysis and what the data folder consists of.

### Raw Data

The raw data for this analysis is derived from the American Community Survey(ACS) Public Use Microdata Sample (PUMS) for the years 2009-2020, and it is available on their [website](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/access.html) along with detailed [documentation](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata/documentation.html). This annual raw data can be downloaded in either SAS or CSV format from their File Transfer Protocol (FTP) site.
